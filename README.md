##Overview
A work-in-progress repo with a simple Android To-Do list app (compile SDK v28, Lollipop 5.0) written in Java built with Gradle. SimpLister allows users to always keep track of the tasks at hand, have multiple to-do lists always available and easily share things with others. Basic functionality involves adding one of the following types of notes:
- Quickly populating the app with simple text notes
- Adding lists of items with checking/unchecking functionality
- Creating location-based notes, complete with Google Maps integration
- Uploading images from user's Gallery as reminders (with an ability to expand them from a thumbnail)
- Attaching dates from a custom DatePicker as an addition to user's notes

After you no longer need a note, just swipe it off the screen and it's gone. Tap on the note's text to expand it. SimpLister also features a settings menu, dark mode, "about" menu and a cool custom floating action button speed dial. All of the user's notes are fully ready to be shared at a tap of a button and come with an automatically generated timestamp of date created.

##Work-in-progress
Currently in construction:
- Tablet/Landscape orientation-friendly layouts
- Persistent data saving
- Full calendar integration
- Various bug/layout fixes and smoother animations
- If someone can make the dialogs less ugly, that'd be great!

##Contribute - suggest - comment
I'd highly appreciate comments, suggestions and contributions! As the whole thing is done by me alone, sometimes it's really easy to get lost.
